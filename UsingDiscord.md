# Welcome to Inception Music!

In this quick series of images, I hope to show you how to use Discord. If you have any questions, just type them into `#help`!

## Navigating Discord

Discord is a chat messaging service with some cool features built into it. For example pinging (to get people's attention) and channels (for different topics).

**These are channels, they contain different topics, usually named appropriately:**

> You can navigate between channels by clicking on them!

Channels are the backbone of Discord. They allow many different people to talk at once without them tripping over each other.

**Here's an example of a ping:**

> You can ping by typing `@` followed by the person's username (or just click on their name in the pop up box) for example, `@ComfyBot`

As you can see, the message is highlighted in a yellow colour and it stands out. Its also adds a small red 1 beside the channel you were pinged in, aswell as the server. This is quite useful for grabbing attention, but can get very annoying quite quickly, so use them sparingly!

## Closing remarks

If you've managed to get this far, then you have all you need to start using Discord! If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ping me in `#general`!
